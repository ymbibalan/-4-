# 𝐀𝐠𝐢𝐥𝐞 𝐌𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐝𝐬 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐒𝐨𝐟𝐭𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐃𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐬

At the beginning of 2020, when the pandemic started and we all moved from offices to homes, with the suggestion and support of Reza Rahmati and Mohammad Nadi, I started to develop an "𝐀𝐠𝐢𝐥𝐞 𝐌𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐝𝐬 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐒𝐨𝐟𝐭𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐃𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐬" course for the Iranian-Canadian Programmers Association.
I picked some of the most important topics in agile methods that are usually useful to programmers and developers based on my experience. It was an exciting and challenging course because it was my first online course as an instructor, and the participants were from Canada coast to coast with diverse backgrounds and experiences. 
The video lectures are available on YouTube now and can be found at https://lnkd.in/dRBKXMYK.

Finally, I would like to thank my friends, Faezeh Eshragh, Reza Moghaddas, Hossein Nassiri, Reza Rahmati, and Mohammad Nadi, for their help and support.
